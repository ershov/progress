.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page briefly documents the \fBprogress\fP command.
.PP
This tool can be described as a Tiny, Dirty, C command
that looks for coreutils basic commands (cp, mv, dd, tar, gzip/gunzip,
cat, etc.) currently running on your system and displays the
percentage of copied data.

It can now also estimate throughput (using flag
.BR \-w ).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-q (\-\-quiet)
hides all messages
.TP
.B \-d (\-\-debug)
shows all warning/error messages
.TP
.B \-w (\-\-wait)
estimate I/O throughput and estimated remaining time (slower display)
.TP
.B \-W (\-\-wait\-delay secs)
wait 'secs' seconds for I/O estimation (implies
.BR \-w )
.TP
.B \-m (\-\-monitor)
loop while monitored processes are still running
.TP
.B \-M (\-\-monitor\-continuously)
like monitor but never stop (similar to
.BR "watch progress" )
.TP
.B \-c (\-\-command cmd)
monitor only this command name (ex: firefox). This option can be used multiple
times on the command line.
.TP
.B \-a (\-\-additional-command cmd)
add this command to the default list. This option can be used multiple
times on the command line.
.TP
.B \-p (\-\-pid id)
monitor only this numeric process ID (ex: \`pidof firefox\`). This option can
be used multiple times on the command line.
.TP
.B \-i (\-\-ignore-file file)

This option can be used multiple times on the command line.
See
.SM
.B NOTE About File Paths

See
.SM
.B NOTE About File Paths

useful when you want to monitor only output files (or input ones) of a process.
.TP
.B \-A (\-\-all-files)
report all files of the process, not just the biggest one. This is useful when
monitoring processes with multiple inputs or outputs like multistream ffmpeg
conversion.
.TP
.B \-v (\-\-version)
show program version and exit
.TP
.B \-h (\-\-help)
display help message and exit

.SH NOTE About File Paths
If the specified file contains '/', it's treated as exact file name.
If the file does not exist yet, you must give a full and clean absolute path.
.PP
If the given file doesn't have a '/' in it, it's treated as file mask which is
matched against the file name portion of the full path.
To specify an exact file name in the current directory, use "./file".


.SH ENVIRONMENT
It's possible to give permanent options using PROGRESS_ARGS environment variable.
See example below. Command line arguments take precedence over environment.
